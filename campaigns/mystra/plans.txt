Introduction

Enter what you know as realmspace, as we zoom into the Universe of this story, you see a small point get bigger and bigger into what reveals to be a Sun and as we look around we see an Earth-like planet, Toril. We orbit around to the dark side of Toril and see a moon shines towards the planet, Selûne as you call it, has a part of its surface dispersed into space in a cone-like shape. We zoom in further into the darker side of the continent of Faerun and zoom through the clouds where a blizzard rages as we see the peaks of an Everest like mountain, Khorok Azwyr more commonly referred to as the ice mountains. Inside the mountain we enter through hidden passages and through the mineshafts and dwell inside a magnificent underground city, we see a door with the sign saying Khwarad in dwarven script and as we enter we see a hairy toddler laying his head on his mothers lap as she entertains him with tales of Faerun. She says, 


“Once upon a time, in our magical land filled with wonders, there lived a little wizard named Willy. Willy was unlike any other children, as he held a special gift – he could use magic! 

In this realm, there is something called the Weave. Imagine the Weave as magical threads that surround everything, like a cozy blanket of spells and wonders. The Weave is what makes magic possible, like the strings of a magical puppet show.

Now, the Weave was guarded and cared for by two magical beings named Mystryl and Mystra. Mystryl, a wise and kind enchantress, was the first caretaker of the Weave. She wove the threads of magic and made sure that the spells flowed smoothly through the world. Mystryl watched over the land, ensuring that every creature, big or small, could experience the joy of magic.

But one day, Mystryl felt it was time for her to pass on her magical duties. She found a worthy protector in Mystra, a gentle and powerful goddess. Mystra took over the task of safeguarding the Weave, ensuring that magic continued to flourish and bring happiness to all

Now, let's talk about how Willy discovered his magical abilities. One sunny day…”

And she goes on about this story about a boy named Willy and outside you can definitely feel yourself being very fascinated by magic and in that instant we cut back to fighter Khwarad Stoutbelcher, you are out in the moonlight laying on the grass of the plains away from a small town you just stayed by as you reminisce about the past. As you get yourself up and get your thoughts together, you see a teen approaching you with one of his hand waving in the air, shouting,
“Oi, you forgot your handaxe at the bar last night.” 
The boy then converses with Khwarad about what he was doing outside and suggests he come to drink at the tavern. Just as they start to head back, you hear a terrorizing scream from the forest surrounding the town. The boy shrieks and quickly hides behind you and worries about the screams and suggests heading back inside.

If the player chooses to ignore and go back into the town, the scream gets louder as the source gets closer, however invisible to other eyes.

When the Khwarad sees the purple rock or a gem almost like a raw but shiny diamond with sparks emanating from it. As he clocks the gem, everything around him stops (if outside trees stop swaying/ if inside people stop) and you notice a portal starts to appear in front of the rock. If the player decides to run away, Khwarad is met by an image of himself that casts thunderwave on him and is pushed into the portal.

Flying through the portal without a sense of control and weight, Khwarad finally tumbles his way through complete darkness, and as Khwarad exits the portal, his body is filled with a reminiscing chill as he fall into a pile of snow. Khwarad feels the air, smells it even and he still remembers it, the deep frost of his hometown. Khwarad remembers his path back into the underground city and as he makes his way back, Perception Roll (DC 7), if pass, something feels off, you remember that your city was attacked and pillaged by goblins and bugbears, you know that magma filled the streets of this city and yet everything seems to be built back into its old but pristine condition, there are no signs of any sort of destruction happened here. 

The player stops at the center of the city and notices it's a quiet night as usual, just a few drunkards are out at this hour and a few guards stationed at the gate.

If the player notices he has time traveled, release the loud reverberating burp from the tavern followed by cheers. Follow-up by suggesting Khwarad to go to his girlfriend.

If the player does not notice he has time traveled, release the loud reverberating burp from the tavern in the distance followed by cheers. This would definitely tell him that he is back in time and suggest he go to his girlfriend.

Khwarad enters his home and his gf is still there, sleeping. Nanwess then awakens as she hears Khwarad enter. Nanwess chats with Khwarad (could be emotional). Make Khwarad roll a dexterity saving throw as an owlbear slashes at him. Need to make him run to the town center (Nanwess can suggest this) or (Wisdom saving throw, Khwarad’s fear of losing her makes him attempt to leave the place, get caught in town center). Somehow drop her pendant

As they are running away, the two get ambushed by 3 bugbears and 8 goblins + goblin leader (+2 everything). Dexterity Saving throw DC20, Khwarad is knocked away by one of the bugbears and the goblin leader snatches away Nanwess, who is now screaming for help as she sees her boyfriend in trouble. Wait for him to kill one bugbear and then the goblin leader feels threatened… time slows, Khwarad notices the goblin starts to push his shortsword against Nanwess’s throat and he also sees himself but younger walk up from the shadows with a sense of immense horror start to fill his face, as Nanwess’s throat is slit open, blood drips down on her baby blue nightgown and her body falls limp on the ground. And just then a portal appears beneath Khwarad and he is teleported out. A drop of blood will transition into rain

========================================================================

Enter Sunshade still nighttime

Need to setup with devil statue in Manor telling Sunshade to head to Boravia with a riddle, “Offer blood to the wandering bat then begin the descent”

Walking through the path towards Ravenloft, Sunshade notices an old hag sitting on the side of the path with a lantern to her side. As you get closer to this hag, she says
“Sweet young boy, would you like to know your future?”

As you clock her, Sunshade you notice she has no pupils and her eyes are marble white. You also notice at her side, a walking stick, a big bowl of gold, copper and silver pieces and there is a bowl filled with various alchemical components. However, her hand lingers above the gold in a protective manner.

Loot: 200 gp, alchemical supplies. 

If Sunshade takes the future reading, he sees vision 1 
If Sunshade does not take the reading, continue on the path until he reaches the barren lands of Boravia.

VISIONS OF SUNSHADE (FLASHES) 

a statue of a winged devil, a bat with red eyes, your body pierced by a bunch of arrows, a female body dripping in blood, a bloody blade piercing through someone.
bloody blade piercing through someone. Sunshade holding the blade, atop a fallen dude with sparks coming out of his hands.

As Sunshade continues to walk ahead, the forest/path clears into an open area filled with a dense mist, Sunshade’s visibility is heavily decreased as he now relies on disadvantage on wisdom checks and attack rolls. If sunshade finds a way or brute force moves onwards, he hears two gruff voices speak, 

“Do you prefer the Material Plane job or the Shadowfell one?”
“Easy, Material plane, this place attracts way more of them”
“So what, you just like to kill 'em’?”
“Yep, I love killing them vampire spawns”

At this point, have sunshade roll a stealth check, no matter roll, have a purple raw magical pylon appear right behind you with sparks and in an instant, a form of scripture starts to appear on top of the pylon reading, “Shulak is alive”. As you read it, the pylon emits a big blinding burst of light and it disappears as you are blinded for a moment. However, from the direction of the guards you hear,

“Mask on boys, I think we caught one”

Make Sunshade take a dexterity saving throw (DC 15) with 6d10+6 damage. Do two rounds of this. 

If Sunshade survives, a perception check will reveal two red dots in the distance, which at closer inspection reveals to be a bat with red eyes (Do cool lightning effects). 

If Sunshade is reduced to 0 HP, the hunters are able to capture him and tie him up to a tree (No items here). Do dialogue with Sunshade as the guards torture him. Try and get thirst levels up

Roll a perception check, as sunshade looks up he notices a bat with red eyes (Do cool lightning effects).

Sunshade is reminded of his instructions, which if he does in any form offer his or the guards blood, the bat entity is content and the bat dives towards Sunshade and teleports him into Shadowfell into Ravenloft with cool Apparate fx from HP movies. 

As Sunshade is teleporting give Vision #2

========================================================================

Transition into a party of adventurers on a carriage speeding down the road, clearly on a quest.There is one human male fighter, female elf sorcerer, male dwarf barbarian and a male gnome cleric. As they arrive in an abandoned town with broken houses and rotting buildings, we see in the background, hidden from the light and deep within the shadows, Akihiro Bruhaven

Enter Akihiro Bruhaven

Akihiro has been tailing and protecting this party of low level adventurers from unseen threats. But keep in mind Akihiro has yet to reveal himself to the party. Akihiro follows them here on his steed/horse through the woods.

These adventurers are in the Ruins of Thundertree, and Akihiro you know that they are here because they got a tip of a large treasure being here. 

Make Akihiro roll Investigation upon the party's arrival in Thundertree. Akihiro notices a very dark green scaly material that he has never seen before, it is light (not metal) and has an unusual color.
 
While Akihiro is busy analyzing the scale, he sees that party has gone into one of the broken houses and are able to fight off a bunch of rotting undead while taking a bit o damage. While the party is in high spirits, you see the adventurers notice a large tower building. As they open the door, they are surprised by a metric fuck ton of gold in the form of coins, bars, crowns with jewels.

As the party of adventurers get busy amazed and just collecting and enjoying the gold, Akihiro can make an Insight or Perception check to get the vibes of the situation, on a failure, Akihiro senses no danger, while on a success Akihiro does feel something is off. 

Following this strange feeling, Akihiro you start to hear crackling noises from behind you and as Akihiro turns around, he sees the magical purple raw diamond/gem crackling with purple sparks, as it takes a moment and above the pylon, a mouth appears saying the following,

“Dragons are one of the most vicious creatures on the planet. Dragons are known to cherish only one thing that is gold as they commonly collect and decorate their lair with gold from plundering. Green dragons, commonly identified by their dark green scales, are among the most cunning of dragons as they love to crush high morals and enjoy torturing enemies.”

As the pylon finishes, Akihiro rolls Arcana check (success reveals the pylon casts it) and notices beams of light sorta like a beacon appear over your adventurers which they don't seem to notice. As a moment passes, you feel the sunlight that was over you a second ago, now fade in and away and as you look up, it is not the clouds blocking the sun, it is a large dragon that is gliding down towards you very quickly. 

Give Akihiro 30 seconds to decide what to do (Party is too busy with the gold.)

Venomfang lands outside the tower, blocking their exit and roars. Give the party fear as they are unable to act for two turns. Venomfang would try to torture Akihiro asking the adventurers to kill Akihiro for freedom but Venomfang would kill the adventurers anyway. 

Before Akihiro is fully able to die, Shar pulls him into her domain and scolds him for acting so freely with his 	owed life. This is where Akihiro would get some red flags from Shar as her temper somewhat explodes and she asks for his devotion once again while setting a failsafe and assigns Akihiro a task of protecting an incubation of Shar’s chosen no questions asked. As shar disappears, Akihiro is on site in Shadowfell, as he notices the pylon in the distance.

========================================================================
Shadowfell

Enter Shadowfell, everyone rolls Strength or Wisdom saving throws here to avoid taking 1d4 necrotic damage from the difficulty to breath and general darkness every so often.

Ask how Khwarad feels. Reinforce emotions of missing Nanwess or emphasize moving on. As Khwarad follows the pylon deeper into the Shadowfell, the landscape grows increasingly desolate and foreboding with dead spiky trees. The air is heavy with an oppressive silence, broken only by the occasional eerie howl of distant creatures. Khwarad’s walk is interrupted by reaching the edge of a vast, mist-shrouded river that stretches as far as the eye can see in both directions. The water flows sluggishly, its surface reflecting the dull light of the Shadowfell in a muted, ghostly glow.

As Khwarad approaches the river, they feel a sense of death and loss wash over them. They instinctively reach out to step onto the riverbank, only to find themselves not being able to pull your other leg forward and after a moment of your confusion, Khwarad gets knocked away 10 ft, roll Dexterity Saving Throw DC 10 to avoid 2d4 bludgeoning damage. No matter how hard they try, they cannot breach the barrier, as if some unseen force is holding them back. Right then, you notice from behind and above you at a distance, a bunch of shiny white wisps start to descend near you and Khwarad is able to identify these wisps as souls which move right past you and fly across the river. Just then you hear a soft melodic voice nearby humming a catchy tune. Some souls, you see, change their trajectory to go to an area behind a boulder to your right. Approaching the back of the rock Khwarad can see an ethereal woman, short in size, sitting on a stump facing the river as she is carving a piece of wood. Khwarad meets dead Nanwess who shall ask him about how he was able to get here, make it emotional? Converse about how to cross the river. River can only be crossed when Nanwess’s soul becomes full again, either my Khwarad releasing the soul from totem or Nanwess entering into the totem.

Nanwess Totem (Name req):
Wondrous Item
Soul Connection: Once per long rest, Khwarad can use an action to focus his thoughts and commune with the soul within the totem. This communion allows him to gain insight into his surroundings, granting advantage on his next Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) check within the next hour.
Echoes of the Past: As Khwarad grows stronger in his connection to the totem, he begins to unlock glimpses of Nanwess' memories stored within. Once per long rest, as a bonus action, Khwarad can channel the totem's power to gain temporary hit points equal to his Fighter level + his Charisma modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute or until depleted.
Bond of Love: The Soulbearer's Totem serves as a symbol of Khwarad's enduring bond with Nanwess. While attuned to the totem, Khwarad gains advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

Once the souls are reorganized both Nanwess and Khwarad are able to cross the river. If the soul is returned, Nanwess passes by Shadowfell and ascends into heaven. Emotional?


Cut to Sunshade, you arrive on the outskirts of a full city as you see at the center of the city stands a large and tall gregorian castle looming over the small huts and sheds across this large city. As Sunshade is looking around, he notices the magical pylon, glowing in and out and it is located away from the city. 

If Sunshade chooses to further explore the city, he learns that the city is named Ravenloft and that the citizens inside the huts are aftaid of him (they speak undercommon). Soon enough, Sunshade sees Shulak inside an alleyway, as he calls to you. A DC 25 Percetion check is required to spot the illusion is being made by the pylon. 

Shulak in an eerie manner calls to Sunshade as he says, “You know I am alive! I am alive, will you come save me? You’ll come won’t you.” as his voice turns more high pitch. And now in an almost screeching voice mixed with a woman’s, he says, “I know where he is, just follow the pylon, and pass the test. Your talents shall reveal your friend’s location”.

as he also walks in the grimy shadowy darkness of the Shadowfell, he however is not quite affected by conditions here as the darkness around Ravenloft soothes him.

can bring out Halia in Ravenloft or outside, near the pylon. Halia revenant surprises Sunshade if he fails a DC 15 Perception check. If he passes, give him vision before revealing and roll initiative. If and when Sunshade IS getting low health, bring in Josepher to defeat Halla and bring the party together near Halia's point of death. At this point one of the characters should have realized that Josepleer has been completely taken over by some entity of chaos and is only coming after the Strongest. At this point all PC'S should be near the BBEG's incubation spot, Make sure Sunshade defeats Josepher. 

[Description of BBEG incubation process goes here]

The Characters are all blasted by some kind of energy blast that "kills” all of them. The PC'S are then transported into Mystra's domain.


Mystra’s Domain
Enter party into a large decagon hall with black and white marble tiled flooring, wooden walls, and just a towering ceiling almost out of view. As everyone starts to look around, there giant hall is segmented into 10 rooms, separated by these purple transparent walls and through which you see, just like you parties of 4-5 people of various races of various equipment and all so slightly injured. 

Just then you all hear from all around the walls, “Awake my champions.”. From the center of the room, where all the transparent walls converged, a new circuals wall moves out from the center, pushing everyone standing close to the center back and a stage forms in that center cleared up space as a beam of dark purple light shines in the middle getting larger and larger and blinding all of you after which you see a ethereal shape of a woman in center about 50 ft tall as she says, “You all have been chosen to save the world, you all have the potential to bring salvation to this realm”. “For I am Goddess of Magic and Keeper of the Weave. I am what you call magic, as I oversee all incantations as if they were my offspring”, “But I am frail, susceptible to threats who wish harm to this world and thus to themselves. Which is why I need you all, champions of mine to find this threat and eliminate it.”

“Now I am sure, you all feel that you were wrongly lured here, but can I assure you this, whatever your needs may be, I can fulfill them at any costs, only if you were to help me. See this as a deal.”

“Currently, my children, you all are vulnerable, emotionally, physically, or spiritually. Thus a perfect state to perform a little personal test, if you truly are capable of helping me.

At this point you see one by one, every room around the hall be covered in thick black opaque smoke, as it arrives and you are blinded unless you have devilsight. As the smoke sets, you feel the glaring heat of a hot sun bask onto you, as you find yourself in a gladiator arena and in place of the people in the 10 rooms around you are these savage-looking, blood dripping sets of monsters, red-eyes, orcs, goblins, bugbear, drow.

“These are some of the strongest savage tribesmen and women from across the continent, known to be cursed by an ever maddening rage, powerful enough that they turn to attack their own kin. Your test starts here. Survive and become my champions.”

She bows and disappears as the walls come down and you hear a bugbear with while clothes yell something in goblish (if someone understands, she yelled “That’s so racist.”).

Battle Royale Begins.


When the battle ends and only a few monsters are left on the battlefield (this can happen if the party is in danger too), Mystra reappears and yells a rebounding “Halt” and everyone gets frozen in place. Purple crystalline fall as rain as the battlefield transforms back into the large hall as the visage drops entirely, revealing the monsters to be all real people with adventuring attire of all different races, except that one bugbear that doesn't transform. As you are completely back in the hall, the magic holding you in position gets undone and a green warm energy starts to heal you all to full health.

Mystra then says, “My champions, rise, for you have achieved victory here. Rejoice, for you have a chance to be blessed by me and ready for an adventure to save the world from chaos.”
“For questions simply pray to me and answers shall be blessed.”

And Mystra swipe fades out and where she stood, swirls a purple pond, most likely a portal.

Here get everyone’s motives in place. Akihiro would see a crow, through which Shar tells him to act as her agent in this plan and give Shar all the info.

========================================================================
Karse: Village

Setting: A fallen island from the times of the Netherese, most likely a mountain. Weirdly, rocky mountain peaks surrounded by flat forests called Dire wood previously known as High Forest, where towns have settled in them.
