Notes for AG (AG is a placeholder name)
- Rune knight
- Believes that everyone should have magic because he is a descendant of Low Netherese who were never blessed with magic and saw the helplessness his people had without magic.
- Mystra currently suppresses the Weave such that no mortal being could bind her or take her down so AG must kill Mystra to get what he wants
- To kill her he researches a decade and finds Karsus' records of his spells and his tresures are still in the Forgotten Realms (High Forest, Faerun). They are still in his keep. AG learned about Karsus' lost runes which he never used. 
- AG doubts runes power and thus must let Mystra be weakened beforehand
- AG needs to find Karsus' Keep and is looking for people for the adventure.
